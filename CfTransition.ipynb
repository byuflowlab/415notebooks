    "## Skin friction coefficient for a flat plate with transition\n",
    "\n",
    "In class we talked about how to estimate the skin friction coefficient for both a laminar and turbulent flat plate boundary layer.  However, most of the time an airfoil is not fully laminar or fully turbulent but rather transitions somewhere along the airfoil.  Accounting for this in a rational way is the subject of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's repeat the skin friction coefficient expressions.  For a laminar boundary we have the analytic Blasius solution:\n",
    "$$ {C_f}_{l} = \\frac{1.328}{\\sqrt{Re_x}}$$\n",
    "and for a turbulent boundary layer we use the semi-empircal formula from Schlichting:\n",
    "$$ {C_f}_{t} = \\frac{0.455}{(log_{10}Re_x)^{2.58}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following derivation we will utilize the figure below.  We start with a laminar region that extends up to the transition location $x_t$.  The turbulent boundary layer begins from there and continues to $c$ (although we use $c$ as it is indicative of chord, this analysis is not restricted to airfoils).  The turbulent boundary layer begins with some thickness, but we can imagine tracing it back to figure out where the turbulent boundary layer would have needed to start in order to develop the same thickness at $x_t$.  We will call this the effective distance $x_e$, and it is defined as a distance upstream of the transition location.  The three regions that we will perform separate calculations on are labeled as 1, 2, and 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "Region 3 is not as straightforward as we can't just start the turbulent calculation from the transition location.  Our formulas are based on starting from the beginning of the boundary layer.  Thus, we first need to calculate the effective distance $x_e$.  \n",

    "The size of the boundary layer can be measured by its momentum thickness $\\theta$ (you will learn more about this if you take ME 515: Aerodynamics).  The Blasius solution provides a formula for this thickness, which we will evalute over a distance $x_t$\n",
